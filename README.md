# Z-Generator
Re do of generator z (first go was definitely not right)

# Description
This is a random password generator that functions based off the users selections they make to certain criterias that they want their passwords to meet.  It is also my first real dive into javascript and let me tell ya, what a headache its been.  I am very pleased to say that this generator is functioning to the best of my knowledge and I am quite a bit more fond of javascript now that i made it through this first one.

# Usage
Use this application to generate a much more secure random password.

# Roadmap
Thats probably it for this particular project.  It was a great challenging introduction to JS.

# Acknowledgements
My Teachers, peers, tutors and loved ones (for keeping me sane through it). W3schools.com, google.com, random github and google found pages where i was able to refresh my memory on ifs,else,else if, find solutions to problems and utilize commands im not super familar with.

# Project Status
COMPLETE
